# Fall-Detection-using-Sensor-Data
This project focuses on detecting falls using sensor data collected from wearable devices. The goal is to classify whether a person has fallen or is performing normal activities based on accelerometer and gyroscope readings. The dataset includes sensor data from multiple body parts, such as the right pocket, belt, neck, and wrist.
